# gopines.gay

[Live: gopines.gay](https://gopines.gay) — a mobile-first planner for getting between Penn Station and Fire Island Pines via the LIRR + Sayville Ferry. Pick a date, pick a direction, see paired train + ferry options ranked by trip quality.

---

## Stack

- **Frontend** — Vite + React 19 + TypeScript. Single-page app, no router. Hand-drawn aesthetic via inline SVG with a wobble filter.
- **Backend** — Firebase Cloud Functions (Node 22, 2nd gen). Two codebases:
  - `lirr` — LIRR static GTFS + GTFS-Realtime
  - `ferry` — Sayville Ferry schedule ingestion (Vision OCR on the website's PNG + positional PDF parsing for ▲ markers and STARTS/ENDS annotations)
- **Persistence** — Firestore. The ferry schedule is cached in `ferry_cache/pines_schedule`.
- **Hosting** — Firebase Hosting; functions are exposed under `/api/*` rewrites.
- **Analytics** — GA4 (`G-FQYXNV8WF6`) loaded in `index.html`. Custom events: `share_trip`, `add_to_calendar`.

```

## Quickstart

First-time auth (gcloud + Firebase login) is in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md). After that:

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix functions/getLIRRDepartures
npm install --prefix functions/getFerrySchedule

npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # type-check + production bundle
npm run deploy       # build + firebase deploy (hosting + functions)
```

The dev server proxies `/api/*` to the live `gopines.web.app` functions, so you don't need the emulator running for normal frontend work.

## How a trip gets built

1. On load, the frontend fetches `/api/lirrScheduleLive?days=14` (LIRR + realtime delays for the next 14 days) and `/api/ferrySchedule` (the cached ferry timetable from Firestore).
2. For the selected date and direction, `buildToPines` / `buildToPenn` in `src/App.tsx` pair LIRR journeys with ferry departures using a 10-minute walk buffer at Sayville Station.
3. Each candidate trip is filtered:
   - Hard cap: total trip time `≤ 240 min` (4h)
   - Hard cap: Sayville layover `≤ 120 min` (2h)
   - Day-of-week: ferries run on the right weekday for the selected date (`daysOfWeek` from the parser)
   - Effective dates: `effectiveStart` / `effectiveEnd` from the PDF's STARTS/ENDS annotations are honored
4. Surviving trips are classified:
   - **best** (green) — total `< 3h` AND Sayville layover `≥ 20 min`, **and** it is
     the single most efficient (lowest total) such trip for its ferry departure
   - **risky** (amber) — total `< 3h` AND Sayville layover `< 20 min` (rushed transfer)
   - **long** (red) — total `≥ 3h`, **or** a comfortable trip that catches the same
     ferry as a more efficient "best" trip (longer than best, but not risky)

   "Best" means best: for each ferry departure only one trip is "best" — the one that
   leaves Penn latest while still making that boat. Other comfortable trips that catch
   the same ferry (and would otherwise just mean waiting longer at Sayville) are filed
   under "long" rather than shown as best.

   Tunable in `src/App.tsx` via `AVOID_TOTAL_MIN`, `COMFORT_LAYOVER_MIN`, `MAX_LAYOVER_MIN`.

## Daily ingestion jobs

Both data sources have a 6:00 ET scheduled refresh that writes a normalised payload to Firestore. The HTTP endpoints read from Firestore on the request path, with a write-through fallback if the doc is missing or stale.

| Job | Source | Firestore doc | Force endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refreshLirrGtfs` | `gtfslirr.zip` from `rrgtfsfeeds.s3.amazonaws.com` | `lirr_cache/penn_sayville_schedule` | `POST /api/forceRefreshLirrGtfs` |
| `ingestSayvilleFerryPines` | Sayville Ferry website (PNG + PDF) | `ferry_cache/pines_schedule` | `POST /api/forceIngestSayvilleFerryPines` |

The LIRR job parses 14 days at a time. Shorter requests (`?days=2`) slice in-memory from the cached payload. The realtime feed (GTFS-RT delays) is **not** scheduled — it's fetched on the request path with a 1-min cache, because by definition realtime data has to be read at the moment of the request.

## Ferry schedule ingestion

`ingestSayvilleFerryPines` runs daily at 6:00 ET and refreshes the ferry cache.

The parser does two passes:

1. **Vision OCR** on the schedule PNG — clusters words into rows, splits the page into per-day-of-week sections, builds a per-day grid of departure times. Source of truth for *trip existence*.
2. **Positional PDF parse** on the schedule PDF — uses `pdf-parse`'s `pagerender` hook to read each text item's `(x, y)` coordinates. Source of truth for `▲` (Cherry Grove stop indicator, rendered as `p` after font substitution) and `STARTS X` / `ENDS X` / `X ONLY` date annotations.

The two passes are joined on `(dayLabel, direction, HH:MM)`. The PDF augments each Vision trip's `extraStops`, `effectiveStart`, `effectiveEnd`. The PDF carries multiple seasonal schedules (Early Spring, Spring, Late Spring, …); the parser scopes to the active one by matching the schedule's title.

### Forcing a fresh ingest

Either wait for the 6 a.m. cron, or hit the on-demand endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://gopines.gay/api/forceIngestSayvilleFerryPines
```

Returns `{ ok: true, count, parseNotes }`. `parseNotes` looks like `geometry_day_aware+pdf:pdf_positional:78|augmented=78` on a healthy run. `CURRENT_INGEST_VERSION` in `functions/getFerrySchedule/index.js` is bumped whenever parser logic changes meaningfully — the scheduled job re-ingests when the on-disk version doesn't match.

## Hosting rewrites

Defined in `firebase.json`:

| Path | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/lirrSchedule` | `getLirrSchedule` | Static GTFS only |
| `/api/lirrScheduleLive` | `getLirrScheduleLive` | Static + GTFS-Realtime delays for today |
| `/api/lirrRealtime` | `getLirrRealtime` | Raw GTFS-RT summary (debug) |
| `/api/ferrySchedule` | `getFerrySchedule` | Returns the cached ferry doc + optional `nextFerriesFromSayville` if `?trainArrival=<unix>` |
| `/api/forceIngestSayvilleFerryPines` | `forceIngestSayvilleFerryPines` | Re-runs the ferry daily ingest on demand |
| `/api/forceRefreshLirrGtfs` | `forceRefreshLirrGtfs` | Re-runs the LIRR daily refresh on demand |

Everything else SPA-falls back to `/index.html`.

## Analytics

The Google tag is loaded once in `index.html`. Two custom events fire from the frontend:

- **`share_trip`** — fires on a successful share (native share sheet, clipboard copy, or `sms:` fallback). Surfaces: `'card'` (an itinerary card) or `'hero'` (the next-departure hero card).
- **`add_to_calendar`** — fires after the per-card `.ics` download is handed off. `'card'` only.

Both events ride this payload:

```ts
{
  direction: 'to-pines' | 'to-penn',
  trip_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  depart_time: 'HH:MM',
  total_min: number,
  stoplight: 'green' | 'amber' | 'red',
  surface: 'card' | 'hero',
}
```

To slice by `direction` / `surface` / etc. in standard reports, register them as custom dimensions in **GA Admin → Data display → Custom definitions**. Until then they're attached to events but only visible in Realtime.

## Deployment notes

- `npm run deploy` rebuilds the frontend and deploys hosting + both function codebases. Unchanged functions are skipped automatically.
- Firestore rules deny all client reads/writes — frontend talks to functions, functions use Admin SDK.
- The ferry parser bumps `CURRENT_INGEST_VERSION` whenever its logic changes; the next scheduled run picks up the new parser even if the underlying PNG/PDF URLs haven't changed.

## Tweaks worth knowing

| What | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Total-trip-time hard cap | `buildToPines`/`buildToPenn` in `src/App.tsx` | 240 min |
| Sayville layover hard cap | `MAX_LAYOVER_MIN` | 120 min |
| Ferry crossing time | `FERRY_MIN` | 30 min |
| Walk from Sayville Station to ferry dock | `WALK_MIN` (frontend) / `WALK_FROM_STATION_SEC` (functions) | 10 min / 600 s |
| Stoplight thresholds | `AVOID_TOTAL_MIN`, `COMFORT_LAYOVER_MIN` | 180 min, 20 min |
| GA tag ID | `index.html` | `G-FQYXNV8WF6` |

## Limitations

- The LIRR static GTFS is refreshed once a day at 6:00 ET; intra-day timetable changes published by the MTA won't appear until the next morning (or until someone hits `/api/forceRefreshLirrGtfs`).
- Realtime delays merge for *today only*; future-dated plans use scheduled times.
- Ferry OCR is calibrated to the current Sayville Ferry website layout. A redesign on their end may need parser tweaks.
- Adblockers strip the GA tag; analytics counts will be lower than reality.
